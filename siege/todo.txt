== WARNING ==
Inside a destructor, all references to GC allocated memory are invalid (except the "this" reference)
Will need to change the way C functions are called in ~this()

<DarkUranium> in that case, I can have an array of pointers "to be deleted"
<DarkUranium> in ~this, the "already deleted" elements are removed, and new elements to delete are added
<DarkUranium> and each loop, a function can go through the array and delete the elements to delete (and set the value to null on the element - that way, it doesn't change the size of the array)
<DarkUranium> in other words, ~this removes the null values from the array and adds a bunch of new ones, while the loop deletes whatever those values in the array point to

PERSONAL NOTES
--------------
TH3O3N/N3O:
- UI?
- smooth paths
- draw.line.smooth
- polynomial/spline interpolation (spline is of higher importance)
- remove all the constants in genetic algos and move them into classes
- hull -> methods to convert a hull into a set of convex hulls

TIM:
- rewrite the console
- demo system
- object serialization
- XML/OpenRJ/config/JSON parsing
- event queues
- UI
NetSyncTest

BUGS
----
- font size returns wrong (too big) size for non-monospace fonts
- all sounds stop playing after a while (probably because they are not removed when done playing)
