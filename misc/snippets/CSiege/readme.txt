Since parts of SIEGE are going to be ported to C,
here are some of the snippets which will later be
modified for it along with different "prototypes"
(not in the C header sense, but in the design sense)

Note that they may/may not compile out of the box

Also note that this is most likely not the prettiest
code you've ever seen...
